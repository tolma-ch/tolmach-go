# tolmach-go

This repo is an attempt to modern re-create of the [original Tolma.ch computer-assisted translation service](https://github.com/tolma-ch/tolmach)

New version is planned to be split into two parts: separate backend with open REST-api (this repo) and separate frontend (not planned to be done any time soon - great place for you to take part in creating something beautiful!).
